Thansks for give me this opportunity

Setup Instructions 
* Open github url

* To clone file open file in vs code or any
   open terminal write clone space url that you copied

Lets start with the Navbar

*As it is Navbar given in figma design , like width, height or fornts all i have extracted from figma to design navbar
*It is easy to design navbar there no complex while design navbar

Home Page/Hero Section
* As data show in hero section I have taken this data from json file that you provided
* I didn't hard code any of this like description, Titles ect
* In first Card I have rendered all data dynamically 
* to render this data I have taken the help of Javascript to render the data dynamically

Hero Section->Cards 
* render data in first card i didn't use any loop because we need to render different data 
from other cards
* But in other 3 cards i used loop(forEach) to render data dynamically 
* In loop I have taken only Title, Description.
* why not render information in cards dynamically?
  Because i didn't get these data from json file so i hardcoded this 

Left Sidebar
* In left sidebar I didn't add click functionality 
* But i have added hove effect if any one hover on sidebar it will and show data
* and also add some animation for open and close arrow 

Right Sidebar
* In right sidebar i used the some special css properties to show letters one by one
   properties(writing-mode: vertical-rl,  text-orientation: upright)
